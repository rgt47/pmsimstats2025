\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Classic crossover trials and aggregated N-of-1 trials share surface similarities, including repeated administration of treatments within individuals and frequent use of mixed-effects models. However, despite this overlap, the designs differ fundamentally in structure, inferential goals, estimands, replication, and statistical modeling. This white paper elaborates on these differences and provides a PTSD example.

\section{Introduction}
Repeated-treatment clinical trial designs reduce between-person variability by allowing each participant to serve as their own control \citep{Jones2014}. N-of-1 trials extend this by providing dense repeated observations per participant \citep{Lillie2011, Guyatt2000}. Despite surface similarities, the inferential goals and statistical structures differ \citep{Senn2002}.
